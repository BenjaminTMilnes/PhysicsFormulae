The Definition of Velocity

The velocity of an object is the rate of change in that object's position with respect to time.

\textbf{v}(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d} \textbf{s}(t)}{\mathrm{d} t}

where:

\textbf{v}(t) [var. vec. Velocity] is the velocity of the object as a function of time
\textbf{s}(t) [var. vec. Position] is the position of the object as a function of time
t [var. Time] is time
