The Definition of Electrical Resistivity

Electrical resistivity is a property of a material that quantifies how strongly it opposes the flow of electric current.

\rho = R \frac{A}{l}

where:

\rho [const. scal. Resistivity] is the resistivity of the material
R [var. scal. Resistance] is the resistance of a piece of the material with a constant cross-sectional area
A [var. scal. CrossSectionalArea, L^{2}, m^{2}] is the cross-sectional area of the piece of material
l [var. scal. Length, L, m] is the length of the piece of the material
