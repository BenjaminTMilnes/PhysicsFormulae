The Formula for the Total Resistance of Electrical Components Connected in Series

For electrical components that are connected in series, the total resistance of all of the components is the sum of the resistance of each component.

R_{\text{total}} = \sum_{j} R_{j}

where:

R_{\text{total}} [var. scal. TotalResistance] is the total resistance of all of the components
R_{j} [var. scal. Resistance] is the resistance of component $j$

variants:

Without the summation sign

R_{\text{total}} = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3} ...
