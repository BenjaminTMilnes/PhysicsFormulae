Hooke's Law

For an ideal spring, the amount of force needed to compress or extend a spring by a given distance, $x$, is proportional to $x$.

F = -kx

where:

F [var. scal. Force] is the force exerted by the spring
k [const. scal. SpringConstant] is the spring constant - a constant factor dependent on the properties of the spring, such as the stiffness of the material
x [var. scal. Distance] is the amount by which the spring has been extended or compressed from its equilibrium point
