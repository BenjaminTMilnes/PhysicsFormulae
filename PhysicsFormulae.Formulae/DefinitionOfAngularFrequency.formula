The Definition of Angular Frequency

Angular frequency is the number of counts per unit time that a rotating system completes one full rotation, or an oscillating system completes one full oscillation, where one full rotation or oscillation is represented as $2 \pi$ radians.

\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{T}

where:

\omega [var. scal. AngularFrequency] is the angular frequency
T [var. scal. Period] is the period of rotation or oscillation

variants:

In terms of frequency

\omega = 2 \pi f
