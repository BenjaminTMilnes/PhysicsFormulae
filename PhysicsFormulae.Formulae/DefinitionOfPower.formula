DefinitionOfPower

The Definition of Power

Power is the rate of transfer or consumption of energy with respect to time.

P = \frac{\mathrm{d} E (t)}{\mathrm{d} t}

where:

P [var. scal. Power] is the power
E (t) [var. scal. Energy] is the energy transferred or consumed as a function of time
t [var. scal. Time] is time

variants:

Simplified Notation

P = \frac{\mathrm{d} E}{\mathrm{d} t}

The function parameters are often just implied.

---

Constant or Average Power

P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}

If the power is constant over the period of time being examined, the power can be expressed as just the amount of energy transferred or consumed divided by the time period.

---

Energy used as a function of power and time

\Delta E = P \Delta t

The energy used by a process can be found by multiplying the power by the time period (if the power is constant).
