The Definition of Angular Velocity

Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular position with respect to time.

\bar{\omega} = \frac{\mathrm{d} \bar{\theta}}{\mathrm{d} t}

where:

\bar{\omega} [var. vec. AngularVelocity] is the angular velocity
\bar{\theta} [var. vec. AngularPosition] is the angular position
t [var. Time] is time
