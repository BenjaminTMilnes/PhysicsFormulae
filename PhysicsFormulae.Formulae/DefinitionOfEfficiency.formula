The Definition of Efficiency

The efficiency of a process is the ratio of its useful energy or power output to its total energy or power input.

\eta = \frac{E_{\text{useful}}}{E_{\text{total}}}

where:

\eta [var. scal. Efficiency] is the efficiency of the process
E_{\text{useful}} [var. scal. UsefulEnergyOutput] is the useful energy output of the process
E_{\text{total}} [var. scal. TotalEnergyInput] is the total energy input of the process

variants:

In terms of power

\eta = \frac{P_{\text{useful}}}{P_{\text{total}}}
