WaveSpeedFormula

The Wave Speed Formula

The speed of a non-dispersive wave is equal to the frequency of the wave multiplied by its wavelength.

v = f \lambda

where:

v [var. scal. WaveSpeed] is the speed of the wave
f [var. scal. WaveFrequency] is the frequency of the wave
\lambda [var. scal. Wavelength] is the wavelength of the wave
