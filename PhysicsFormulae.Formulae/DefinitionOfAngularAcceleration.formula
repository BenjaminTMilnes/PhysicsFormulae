The Definition of Angular Acceleration

Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity.

\alpha = \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{\mathrm{d} t}

where:

\alpha [var. vec. AngularAcceleration] is the angular acceleration
\omega [var. vec. AngularVelocity] is the angular velocity
t [var. scal. Time] is time
