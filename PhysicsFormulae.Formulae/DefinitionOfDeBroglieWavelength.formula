DefinitionOfDeBroglieWavelength

The Definition of the de Broglie Wavelength

The de Broglie wavelength is the wavelength associated with a massive particle, and is dependent on the particle's momentum.

\lambda = \frac{h}{p}

where:

\lambda [var. scal. DeBroglieWavelength] is the de Broglie wavelength of the particle
h [const. scal. PlanckConstant] is the Planck Constant
p [var. scal. Momentum] is the momentum of the particle
