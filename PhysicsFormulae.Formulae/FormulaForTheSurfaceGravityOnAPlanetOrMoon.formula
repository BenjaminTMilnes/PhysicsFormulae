The Formula for the Surface Gravity on a Planet or Moon

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a spherical astronomical body is proportional to the mass of the body and inversely proportional to the radius of the body.

a = \frac{GM}{R^{2}}

where:

a [var. scal. SurfaceGravity, L T^{-2}, m s^{-2}] is the surface gravity
G [const. scal. UniversalGravitationalConstant] is the Universal Gravitational Constant
M [var. scal. Mass, M, kg] is the mass of the body
R [var. scal. Radius, L, km] is the radius of the body
