The Third Law of Thermodynamics

The entropy of a perfect crystal of any pure substance approaches zero as the temperature approaches zero.

S = k_{B} \ln \Omega

where:

S [var. scal. Entropy] is the entropy
k_{B} [const. scal. BoltzmannConstant] is the Boltzmann Constant
\Omega [var. scal. NumberOfMicrostates] is the number of microstates
