NewtonsLawOfGravitation

Newton's Law of Gravitation

F = G \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{r^{2}}

where:

F [var. GravitationalForce] is a force pointing along a line 
G [const. UniversalGravitationalConstant] is the universal gravitational constant
m_{1} [var.] is the mass of the first object
m_{2} [var.] is the mass of the second object
r [var.] is the distance between the two point masses

can be derived from:
